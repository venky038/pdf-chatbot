[TASK]
Based on the research context above and the user's last query, generate 3 strategic follow-up questions that help the user dive deeper into the data.

[RULES]
1. Variety: Ensure questions cover different angles (e.g., one technical, one conceptual, one application-oriented).
2. Conciseness: Keep each question under 15 words.
3. Logical Flow: The questions should feel like a natural progression of the research.

[OUTPUT]
Return ONLY a valid JSON list of strings. 
Example: ["How does X impact Y?", "What are the specific requirements for Z?", "Can you explain the methodology used?"]
